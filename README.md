# Leaf Condition Classification
A web application for classifying the condition of a leaf using Teachable Machine's self trained model. Users can upload images of leaves to predict their condition.

## Features
1. **Image Upload:** Upload a leaf image for condition analysis.
2. **TensorFlow.js Model:** Uses a pre-trained model from Teachable Machine.
3. **Responsive UI:** Simple, user-friendly interface with webcam and image upload options.
4. **Prediction Display:** Provides predictions with probabilities for each class.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:

   ```git clone
   https://github.com/pukhraj1002/leaf-condition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```terminal
   cd leaf-condition
   ```

3. Run the app (open index.html in a browser):
   For image uploads, click "Upload Image" and select an image.
   View the prediction result below.

## Technologies Used
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For frontend interface and styling.
TensorFlow.js: For running the machine learning model in the browser.
Teachable Machine: Pre-trained image classification model.

## Model
This project uses a model hosted on Teachable Machine for classifying leaf conditions.
