# Leaf Condition Classification
A web application for classifying the condition of a leaf using Teachable Machine's pre-trained model. Users can upload images of leaves to predict their condition.

## Features
Image Upload: Upload a leaf image for condition analysis.

TensorFlow.js Model: Uses a pre-trained model from Teachable Machine.

Responsive UI: Simple, user-friendly interface with webcam and image upload options.

Prediction Display: Provides predictions with probabilities for each class.

## How to Use
### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/pukhraj1002/leaf-condition.git

### Navigate to the project directory:
cd leaf-condition

### Run the app (open index.html in a browser):
For image uploads, click "Upload Image" and select an image.
View the prediction result below.

## Technologies Used
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For frontend interface and styling.
TensorFlow.js: For running the machine learning model in the browser.
Teachable Machine: Pre-trained image classification model.

## Model
This project uses a model hosted on Teachable Machine for classifying leaf conditions.
